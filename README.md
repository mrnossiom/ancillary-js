# Usage

You can check the current library interface in `src/ancillaire.h`

Both `bun` and `deno` are supported because they can open a shared library (`.so`). 

# Building

## Tools

Check the `nativeBuildInputs` of the `flake.nix` file to get the up-to-date required tools.

They include
- `just`
- a C compiler (`clang`, `gcc`)
- your prefered supported JS runtime (`bun`, `deno`)

## Building

```sh
# Build the libancillaire bindings to `build/libancillaire.so`.
just buildc
```

You can then use `bun`/`deno` ffi features to open and access the shared library.
